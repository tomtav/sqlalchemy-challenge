#  Climate Analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii

![beach.jpg](images/beach.jpg)

I've decided to take a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help plan my trip, I will perform a climate analysis of the area.

I did find that the weather is definitely better than in NYC all year round. I can see myself planning a trip anytime of the year. I can see myself taking a trip during the winter holidays since the weather still seems to average in the 70's during the school winter break.

You can review my [Analysis notebook](analysis.ipynb) to see more a more detailed analysis of the temperatures from 2010 to 2017.
